A prefix sum algorithm is a technique used to calculate cumulative sums of array elements, creating a new array where each element is the sum of all previous elements. This allows for efficient computation of range sum queries in constant time.

To implement a prefix sum array, iterate through the original array and create a new array where each element is the sum of all previous elements, including the current one. This precomputation allows for quick range sum calculations later.

Prefix sum is commonly used in various scenarios, including range sum queries, finding subarrays with specific properties, optimizing time complexity in certain algorithms, and solving problems related to cumulative frequencies or probabilities.

While prefix sum calculates cumulative sums from left to right in an array, suffix sum does the opposite, calculating cumulative sums from right to left. Both techniques can be used to solve different types of problems efficiently.

The time complexity for creating a prefix sum array is O(n), where n is the number of elements. Once created, range sum queries can be performed in O(1) time, making it highly efficient for multiple queries.
