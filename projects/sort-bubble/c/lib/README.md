The lib directory contains third-party libraries that the project depends on. For example, lucavallin/gnaro makes use of the argtable and log.c libraries for parsing CLI arguments and logging, respectively.

There is not much to say about this directory. It's just a place to put your dependencies. Again, don't forget to include these in the Makefile as well, by the way.
